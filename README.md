# Packet Flow Visualizer (OSI + TCP/IP)

A mini project that visually demonstrates how a simple message (e.g., "Hello") travels across a network through OSI and TCP/IP layers.  
It shows the encapsulation process step by step:  
**Data → Segment → Packet → Frame**

## 📌 Features
- Enter a message and start visualization
- Layer-wise progress (Application, Transport, Internet, Network Access)
- OSI ↔ TCP/IP layer mapping
- Transformation details with headers added at each layer
- Wire view showing final encapsulated frame
- Step-by-step animation control

## 🧠 Concepts Covered
- OSI Model layers
- TCP/IP Model layers
- Encapsulation process
- TCP, IP, and Ethernet framing (simulated)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python (GUI)
- Tkinter / Custom UI (if used)
- No real packet capture (simulation-based learning tool)

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Run the app

🎯 Learning Outcome

This project helps beginners understand how data is encapsulated and travels through OSI and TCP/IP layers in real networking communication.

📌 Future Improvements

Real packet capture integration
Protocol detection
OSI layer classification
Export logs
